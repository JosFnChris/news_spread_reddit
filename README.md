What is this thing for?
======================

Donwload and analyse Reddit submissions from specific domains.
Right now, the domains are:

* dailymail.co.uk
* thesun.co.uk
* news.bbc.co.uk
* theguardian.com
* telegraph.co.uk
* breitbart.com
* nationalenquirer.com
* cnn.com
* washingtonpost.com
* abcnews.go.com
* rt.com

How do I get it to work?
=
You just need to create the following folders in the same directory as the scripts:
- analysis
- data
- merged
- temp_data

**v 0.01:** No idea, but I will improve the way this works this weekend...maybe...don't know.
